# CVE-2020-8554 demo

This is based on Etienne's [blog post](https://blog.champtar.fr/K8S_MITM_LoadBalancer_ExternalIPs/). this should work in any Kubernetes cluster that doesn't have specific admission controller policies designed to stop it.

1. `kubectl create -f client-pod.yaml`
2. `kubectl exec client-pod -- curl -s http://icanhazip.com` - This should return your external IP address
3. `kubectl create -f deployment.yaml`
4. `kubectl create -f service.yaml`
5. `kubectl exec client-pod -- curl -s http://icanhazip.com` - This should give the echo response.
